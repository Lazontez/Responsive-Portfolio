                My name is Lazontez Gardner, I was born November 17, 1999. I graduated from Lebanon High School
                in Lebanon,Tn, where I played basketball and performed on the Track Team.I find interest in Sports,Music,Artwork,Astrology,and all forms of creativeness. My influence on joining the
                Tech world would be because its almost obvious and amazing to see how technology and different start up
                ideas have and continue to revolutionize human life and human communication. But, I won't go on my normal 2 day conversation on just how much life has changed and how much it will.
                Anyways, yeah I've seen all the cool web-development advancements and apps and I knew it was something I
                very much wanted to be apart of.
